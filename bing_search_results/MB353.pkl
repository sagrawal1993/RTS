VSeasonal Affective Disorder, or SAD, ... The most common seasonal pattern is for depressive episodes to being in the fall or winter and diminish in the spring. A less common type of SAD, known as summer depression, usually begins in the late spring or early summer. SAD may be related to changes in the amount of daylight a person receives. SAD is not considered as a separate disorder, but rather is a type of depression that has a recurring seasonal pattern.
